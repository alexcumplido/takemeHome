# TakemeHome 2022 |

This project is a work in progress as well as the readme itself. During the following weeks I will be mostly completed.
Currently you can visualize the [deployed project here](https://takemehome-three.vercel.app/).

**Quality test**

## Requirements 🎯

Soon too 🙄

## Usage 📝

Guess what 🙄

## Components 🧬

The project followed a [Component Driven UI](https://www.componentdriven.org/) development methodology creating components from the bottom up and then combining them into complex ones.

The modal component is implemented using [React portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html). Portals let you render a children into a DOM node outside of the DOM hierarchy from its parent component.

## Stack ⚒️

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Vite

As a build tool I used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) because of its fast configuration and also because creating a development environment from the ground up is a great oportunity to realize what dependencies and scripts the project will require.
