# Take Me Home

Take Me Home is a use case application for people looking to adopt an animal from a local rescue shelter. The association relied mostly on social media platforms to spread information about animals waiting to be adopted. Interest from people about the animals it was lost in the feed timeline. Therefore, this solution aims to connect people interested in adopting them with the shelter.

This project is consuming the [Petfinder JS SDK](https://github.com/petfinder-com/petfinder-js-sdk/tree/master/docs#v2-api) so a complete query and filter with real animals can be performed by the user itself. Currently you can visualize the [deployed project here](https://takeme-home.vercel.app/).
